      "I had no idea what python classes were as of a week ago and only had a vague notion of what object oriented programming even was. I needed help. To make matters worse, the only resources I could find online were contrived examples. But, through a lot of guesswork, bug fixing, and exploration, I developed a working knowledge of class and object oriented methods. This blog post will be an attempt at saving others from some of the pain I felt.\n",

      "This could easily be a field of rabbit holes, so I\u2019m going to highlight just a few key components of creating a class in python. This blog post is static but was created in an ipython notebook, available on github. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of playing around with class definitions to understand how they work. So clone the repository (ie. \"download it\", for the git unsavvy), run either the all-inclusive ipython notebook or just run the python scripts, and see what happens when you start changing things. That said, let\u2019s get started.\n",

Only that we have a bunch of spherical-looking objects floating around pretty close to each other. We also know that we\u2019re going to be collecting a similar (but unique!) set of information about each of these objects like their name, size, etc. Finally, we\u2019re going to want to be able to define functions for the objects, like calculating the volume.
