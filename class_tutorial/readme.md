# Python Classes Tutorial

I created this tutorial to try and make learning classes a little bit easier for
beginners. The ipython notebook is totall self contained and is the easiest way
to get going if you already have ipython installed. If you don't and you'd
rather skip the installation, I've also included python scripts that you can run
from the terminal. Just use the bash script `python execute classes`. I highly
encourage you to change the code around, either in the scripts or in the
notebook. Have fun!
